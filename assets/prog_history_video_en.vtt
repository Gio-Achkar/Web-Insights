00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.358
Nowadays, programming languages are all

00:00:01.358 --> 00:00:03.338
around us. It's how we keep the systems

00:00:03.338 --> 00:00:05.071
and devices we use every day operating

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:06.803
and running smoothly. They allow for us

00:00:06.803 --> 00:00:08.536
measly humans to interact and make cool,

00:00:08.536 --> 00:00:10.516
fun, or random things just by tapping a

00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:12.497
few buttons. In fact, I would guess if

00:00:12.497 --> 00:00:13.982
you're watching this video, you probably

00:00:13.982 --> 00:00:15.467
know a few programming languages. But

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:16.952
what was the first programming language?

00:00:16.952 --> 00:00:18.932
Well, if you look this up on Google,

00:00:18.932 --> 00:00:20.170
you're going to find varying reults.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.988
People claim that maybe it's Autocode by

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:25.136
Alick Glennie in the early 1950s, or

00:00:25.136 --> 00:00:27.284
maybe it's Fortran, also developed in the

00:00:27.284 --> 00:00:29.125
1950s, but in all actuality computer

00:00:29.125 --> 00:00:30.966
science, when it relates to programming

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.500
started much earlier than this.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.447
Computer science, when it relates to

00:00:38.447 --> 00:00:40.143
programming, actually dates way back as

00:00:40.143 --> 00:00:42.406
far as 1843 with Ada Lovelace and her

00:00:42.406 --> 00:00:44.102
experimentations. I'm not going to bore

00:00:44.102 --> 00:00:46.365
you to death with the details of the

00:00:46.365 --> 00:00:47.779
1800s computer science concepts, but

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:49.758
there are a few things that she

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:51.455
understood that paved the way and

00:00:51.455 --> 00:00:53.152
honestly started the foundation of all

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:54.933
computer programming languages as we know

00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.182
it, when Ada Lovelace was young she was

00:00:57.182 --> 00:00:58.868
incredibly intelligent, so much so that

00:00:58.868 --> 00:01:00.836
her mathematical talents led her to a

00:01:00.836 --> 00:01:02.241
long and rewarding friendship with

00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:03.928
Charles Babbage, the known father of

00:01:03.928 --> 00:01:05.895
computers. Now what we really need to

00:01:05.895 --> 00:01:07.863
know is that Charles Babbage had a

00:01:07.863 --> 00:01:09.549
breakthrough in the 1820s inventing the

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:10.955
difference machine. This was literally

00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:12.360
the first successful fully automatic

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.328
calculator, and to be honest, that was

00:01:14.328 --> 00:01:17.278
its main purpose. But this was out of the

00:01:17.278 --> 00:01:18.907
world, unthinkable at the time. Lovelace

00:01:18.907 --> 00:01:20.535
seen this and immediately had a

00:01:20.535 --> 00:01:22.435
revelation of her own. She realized that

00:01:22.435 --> 00:01:24.335
Babbage's machine could do much more than

00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:26.235
just calculate. It was a general purpose

00:01:26.235 --> 00:01:28.135
machine for whatever you might want to

00:01:28.135 --> 00:01:30.035
do. In fact, Lovelace was the first

00:01:30.035 --> 00:01:31.935
person to make the leap that numbers

00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:33.292
could actually represent other things

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:34.649
digitally. Right then, the idea

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.482
of Programming languages was first born.

00:01:36.482 --> 00:01:38.571
I actually researched more into this and

00:01:38.571 --> 00:01:40.660
beyond just that. She thought about how

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.748
to repeat a series of instructions with

00:01:42.748 --> 00:01:44.837
machines and came up with looping. She

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:46.926
literally conjured up what loops now are

00:01:46.926 --> 00:01:49.313
with four loops and while loops back in

00:01:49.313 --> 00:01:49.910
the 1800s.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.979
Now, after Ada Lovelace, there was

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.168
actually a huge gap in the timeline. No

00:01:57.168 --> 00:01:59.357
one knew at the time how to convert

00:01:59.357 --> 00:02:00.999
machine code and what machines created

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:02.367
into actual programming languages. This

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:04.009
was until Alan Turing made a

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.104
groundbreaking discovery. Alan Turing,

00:02:05.104 --> 00:02:06.745
another prominent figure in the computer

00:02:06.745 --> 00:02:08.387
science upbringing, was a famous computer

00:02:08.387 --> 00:02:10.303
scientist for his work on cracking Nazi

00:02:10.303 --> 00:02:11.874
Germany's Enigma Code. Turning came him

00:02:11.874 --> 00:02:14.088
up with the concept that built upon Ada

00:02:14.088 --> 00:02:15.749
Lovelace's original ideas, which was that

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:17.687
there very well could be a universal

00:02:17.687 --> 00:02:19.072
machine, one that could follow

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:20.456
instructions and was powered by

00:02:20.456 --> 00:02:21.840
electricity and could run programs.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.923
Shortly after this we had the onslaught

00:02:26.923 --> 00:02:28.397
of actual programming languages appear,

00:02:28.397 --> 00:02:30.460
but many wonder what was the first

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.934
legitimate programming language? Well, it

00:02:31.934 --> 00:02:33.703
turns out the very first programming

00:02:33.703 --> 00:02:35.766
language to actually be used was created

00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:37.830
between 1942 and 1945 and was named

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.188
Plankalkul. I'm not sure how

00:02:40.188 --> 00:02:40.482
it's pronounced.

00:02:44.852 --> 00:02:46.505
Created by Konrad Zuse, Plankalkul was

00:02:46.505 --> 00:02:48.158
the first semi high level programming

00:02:48.158 --> 00:02:50.362
language and it was mainly used to store

00:02:50.362 --> 00:02:52.291
codes which at the time enabled engineers

00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:54.219
to carry out routines or repetitive tasks

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:55.872
way easier than simply doing it

00:02:55.872 --> 00:02:57.525
themselves. Little did Konrad know this

00:02:57.525 --> 00:02:59.454
was the beginning of the onslaught of

00:02:59.454 --> 00:03:01.107
many more programming languages that most

00:03:01.107 --> 00:03:02.760
of us know and love today.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.150
However, while Konrad Zuse was

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.474
creating Plankalkul, there was another

00:03:10.474 --> 00:03:12.467
computer scientist at the University of

00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:14.127
London in Kathleen Booth, another

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:16.119
historical woman figure in the computer

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:17.779
science industry. Kathleen created the

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:19.107
first majorly popular programming

00:03:19.107 --> 00:03:21.432
language at the time in assembly. This

00:03:21.432 --> 00:03:24.088
was first created in 1947 and has been

00:03:24.088 --> 00:03:26.263
used. Nonstop, even up to the present

00:03:26.263 --> 00:03:28.308
date. This was the first public and

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:30.061
accessible step that was above machine

00:03:30.061 --> 00:03:32.107
language and was before the revolution of

00:03:32.107 --> 00:03:34.152
some of the most infamous high level

00:03:34.152 --> 00:03:35.613
programming languages. Assembly in itself

00:03:35.613 --> 00:03:37.658
is a very low level programming language.

00:03:37.658 --> 00:03:39.119
Its intentions are to communicate

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:40.872
directly with the computers hardware via

00:03:40.872 --> 00:03:42.625
keyword access modifiers just like we

00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:43.793
used today. However many

00:03:43.793 --> 00:03:45.248
have described Assembly syntax as

00:03:45.248 --> 00:03:47.027
rigorous and difficult to learn, but once

00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:48.807
you learn it, it shows the true

00:03:48.807 --> 00:03:50.077
relationship between the programmer and

00:03:50.077 --> 00:03:50.840
the computer itself.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.961
After Assembly was created in 1947, many

00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:57.640
of the foundational programming languages

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.319
were built. Fortran, Autocode, Algol,

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.005
COBOL, BASIC, Pascal, C, and SQL, all of

00:04:02.005 --> 00:04:04.020
which dating back before 1975 and

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.707
building what we know to be high level

00:04:06.707 --> 00:04:08.722
programming languages in some ways. Their

00:04:08.722 --> 00:04:10.401
principles were later designed and

00:04:10.401 --> 00:04:12.516
modified off of with newer. Programming

00:04:12.516 --> 00:04:14.710
languages like Java, Python, Ruby, C++,

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.636
PHP, C#, JavaScript, and so many more. At

00:04:17.636 --> 00:04:20.561
the end of the day, all of the

00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:22.756
languages we use today for whatever

00:04:22.756 --> 00:04:24.950
reasons, whether it be game development,

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.413
software engineering, cybersecurity, our

00:04:26.413 --> 00:04:28.607
hobbies our side jobs our careers,

00:04:28.607 --> 00:04:31.167
everything is all thanks to the founding

00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:33.855
fathers of computer science. Thank you

00:04:33.855 --> 00:04:36.240
Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing, Konrad Zuse

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.000
and Kathleen Booth.
