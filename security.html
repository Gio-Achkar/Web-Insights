        <h2>Why Does Security Matter?</h2>
        <p>
          The Internet stands as one of humanity's most influential creations
          because it enables worldwide communication and information sharing.
          The Internet provides numerous advantages to users but it also creates
          substantial security threats. Websites contain diverse types of data,
          which include non-sensitive content and sensitive information
          including usernames, passwords, financial records, proprietary
          algorithms, and private business details. Safeguarding this type of
          information is the central objective of web security
          <a href="references.html#ref9">[9]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>If information of this type is attacked:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The company faces a competitive disadvantage if proprietary
            information is breached.
          </li>
          <li>
            Services could face disruption, be disabled or hijacked which cause
            operational or financial impact.
          </li>
          <li>
            The personal information of customers could be exploited,
            compromising personal privacy, consumer profiling, identity theft,
            or even direct financial loss
            <a href="references.html#ref9">[9]</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Web security has become increasingly important as cyber attacks have
          continued to grow in frequency and cost. Cyber attacks had an
          estimated cost to the global economy of $8 trillion in 2023, and that
          is expected to increase to $10.5 trillion by 2025. Each day there are
          approximately 2200 attacks, which indicates that organizations, users,
          and digital assets all need good security
          <a href="references.html#ref10">[10]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The severity of these threats is reinforced by studies that indicate
          that more than 85% of websites are vulnerable to at least one type of
          attack, which indicates the urgency of having good security
          <a href="references.html#ref11">[11]</a>.

      <section id="security-overview">
        <h2>Overview of Web Security</h2>
        <p>
          Web security refers to the practices, technologies, and protocols that
          protect websites, web applications, and online services from
          unauthorized access, data breaches, and other attacks
          <a href="references.html#ref10">[10]</a>. Web security aims to protect
          sensitive information, IT systems, and the user community to keep the
          web as secure as feasible. Practices and tools include secure
          communications protocols such as HTTPS
          <a href="references.html#ref9">[9]</a>, identity and access controls
          that help ensure only authorized users can reach sensitive data,
          system monitoring tools, firewalls to block unauthorized traffic and
          isolate the local network from external environment, web filtering
          tools to deny access to unsafe content, and antivirus software to
          identify and remove malware <a href="references.html#ref11">[11]</a>.
          Security measures also includes identity authentication using
          multifactor authentication (MFA), encrypting data both while it moves
          across networks (in transit) and when it is stored on servers or
          databases (at rest), regularly identifying vulnerabilities, and
          educating users of common threat actors such as phishing, along with
          frequently monitoring the system to respond quickly to suspicious
          activity <a href="references.html#ref10">[10]</a>. As cyberattacks
          become more frequent, maintaining web security calls for proactive
          measures and frequent updates to protect data and systems.

        <h2>Common Web Threats</h2>
        <p>
          When discussing web threats, it's important to notice that many
          attacks are successful because web applications either place too much
          trust in data received from browsers or fail to handle it with enough
          caution <a href="references.html#ref12">[12]</a>. The following are
          some of the most common threats encountered on the web:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</strong><br />Malicious scripts
            are injected by attackers into a reliable website, and users'
            browsers execute them. This can lead users to dangerous websites,
            steal cookies, or take over sessions. One of the most commonly
            reported vulnerabilities in web applications in the past has been
            XSS <a href="references.html#ref12">[12]</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>SQL Injection (SQLi)</strong><br />Attackers alter or expose
            private data by manipulating input fields, such as search boxes,
            login forms, or URL parameters, to send malicious commands to a
            website's database. The database on the website may be destroyed by
            SQL Injection <a href="references.html#ref13">[13]</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</strong><br />By sending
            requests that the website considers to be authentic, attackers
            deceive a logged-in user into carrying out undesirable actions on
            the website, like altering account settings or completing
            transactions <a href="references.html#ref12">[12]</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Broken Access Control and API Vulnerabilities</strong
            ><br />When a website or API fails to appropriately limit user
            actions, it creates broken access control, which gives hackers
            access to data or features that are not authorized. Attackers can
            target microservices by altering JSON parameters, API keys, or other
            data, or they can take advantage of authentication weaknesses in
            contemporary API-first systems, where web services depend on APIs.
            These flaws may also make it possible for attacks such as cross-site
            request forgery (CSRF), in which programs do not confirm that users
            intended particular actions
            <a href="references.html#ref14">[14]</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Phishing and Spam</strong><br />Phishing is the practice of
            tricking people into sharing passwords, credit card numbers, or
            other private information by using phony websites, emails, or
            messages <a href="references.html#ref15">[15]</a>. Spam frequently
            aids phishing by spreading a lot of false information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Malware Installation</strong><br />Infected downloads,
            advertisements, or links can covertly install malicious software on
            a user's computer. Once operational, it has the ability to damage
            files, track activities, and steal data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Breaches</strong><br />Unauthorized access to a
            company's private data constitutes a data breach. Errors, inadequate
            security, or intentional actions are frequently the cause of these
            incidents. Financial losses, reputational damage to a business,
            legal problems, and possible misuse of personal data are all
            consequences of data breaches
            <a href="references.html#ref10">[10]</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)</strong><br />Attackers
            use numerous compromised computer systems to flood a website or
            server with traffic, rendering it unusable or sluggish for
            authorized users <a href="references.html#ref16">[16]</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clickjacking</strong><br />Attackers may conceal a malicious
            link beneath a genuine button to fool users into clicking on
            something different from what they see. A hidden page under the
            attacker's control may be displayed when a user clicks on what looks
            to be a trustworthy website
            <a href="references.html#ref12">[12]</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cryptographic Failures</strong><br />Sensitive information
            may be exposed to hackers due to inadequate or badly executed
            encryption. This includes failing to secure data during transmission
            or storage, utilizing outdated algorithms, or storing keys in an
            unsafe manner. These flaws make organizations extremely vulnerable
            to increasingly complex attacks
            <a href="references.html#ref14">[14]</a>.

        <h2>Staying Secure Online</h2>
        <p>
          Protecting yourself or your organization from web threats requires a
          combination of good practices, tools, and awareness. The following
          strategies can help reduce risks and improve overall web security:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Use Strong Authentication</strong><br />Use strong passwords
            at all times, don't use the same ones for different accounts, and
            whenever you can, turn on multifactor authentication (MFA).
            Attackers find it more difficult to obtain unauthorized access as a
            result <a href="references.html#ref12">[12]</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Keep Software Up to Date</strong><br />To address known
            vulnerabilities and prevent attacks, apply security patches and
            updates on a regular basis <a href="references.html#ref11">[11]</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Encrypt Sensitive Data</strong><br />Encrypt sensitive data
            during transmission and storage, and use HTTPS for secure
            communication. HTTPS is based on Transport Layer Security (TLS),
            which encrypts data while it is being transmitted to guard against
            third parties intercepting or abusing it. Use strong, modern
            algorithms and safeguard cryptographic keys as well
            <a href="references.html#ref9">[9]</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use Firewalls and Security Tools</strong><br />Use intrusion
            detection systems, firewalls, antivirus programs, and website
            filters to stop malicious traffic and stop malware infections.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Infrastructure Resilience</strong><br />To promptly restore
            systems in the event of DDoS attacks, put backup, logging, and
            incident response plans into action.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
      <section id="security-conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Writing secure code, putting email authentication protocols into
          place, educating users, increasing awareness, and more are examples of
          additional safe practices.
