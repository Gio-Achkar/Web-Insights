        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region experienced a fast
          digital transformation during the last two decades. Mobile
          connectivity has propelled the region toward increased internet
          adoption, yet the region faces ongoing obstacles regarding
          affordability, network development, and usage gaps. Lebanon
          demonstrates one of the highest internet adoption rate in the region,
          although its network speed and performance standards fall short
          compared to worldwide benchmarks. This article presents information on
          adoption, usage, and internet speed statistics for MENA and Lebanon,
          with data current as of 2025.

      <section id="stats-adoption">
        <h2>Internet Adoption and Usage in the MENA Region</h2>
        <p>
          About 70.2% of people in the Arab world had internet access as of
          early 2025 <a href="references.html#ref24">[24]</a>. Nearly 327
          million people, or 49% of the region's population, had mobile internet
          subscriptions by the end of 2023
          <a href="references.html#ref25">[25]</a>, demonstrating that mobile
          internet is still a major factor in this growth. Although most people
          in MENA live within range of a mobile broadband network, there is a
          sizable usage gap, which means that not everyone chooses to subscribe,
          despite the region's high coverage levels. People in MENA are becoming
          more interested in entertainment, convenience, and seamless
          connectivity, as evidenced by the notable growth in online gaming,
          e-commerce, digital payments, and video streaming
          <a href="references.html#ref26">[26]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The high rate of internet adoption in Lebanon makes it unique among
          MENA countries. With an estimated 5.34 million people, or 91.6% of the
          population, online as of early 2025, the nation was significantly
          above the regional average. Social media usage is also considerably
          high, with approximately 4.02 million accounts, which constitutes
          around 68.9% of the population. The number of internet users in
          Lebanon increased by 59 thousand (+1.1%) between January 2024 and
          January 2025, while the overall adoption rate increased by a modest
          0.4%, according to digital research and analytics company Kepios
          <a href="references.html#ref27">[27]</a>. The high adoption rate is
          indicative of Lebanon's technologically engaged population; although
          issues like inadequate infrastructure, economic instability, and
          unequal access to devices still affect usage as a whole. At the
          beginning of 2025, about 491 thousand people, or 8.4% of the
          population, were still offline despite the widespread connectivity
          <a href="references.html#ref27">[27]</a>.

        <h2>Internet Speeds in the Mena Region</h2>
        <p>
          Internet speeds in the MENA regions varies considerably, generally due
          to differing amounts of infrastructure and investment on the part of
          governments. The GCC countries tend to have the greatest speeds across
          both mobile and fixed-line. In 2024, for example, Qatar had the
          highest average mobile download speed in the world, while the UAE was
          in second place among all countries globally, and both are generally
          in the highest category of mobile connectivity across the globe
          <a href="references.html#ref28">[28]</a>. Fixed-line broadband speeds
          also tend to be higher in cities with advanced infrastructure;
          fixed-line data connections can usually deliver faster and more stable
          Internet than mobile broadband connections. Outside of the more
          developed markets of Qatar and the UAE, mobile and fixed-line speeds
          are generally lower, but most markets have ongoing initiatives to
          upgrade their networks which should support faster connections, with
          improvements in mobile broadband speeds anticipated with 4G and early
          5G technology rollouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lebanon's average internet speeds have an uneven profile. In terms of
          mobile broadband, 3G, 4G, and early 5G networks account for 97.6% of
          the total connections, with median mobile download speeds reaching
          approximately 30.20 Mbps by early 2025. Fixed broadband average
          internet speed is 12.78 Mbps but increased by 36.1% from the previous
          year; these figures indicate continuous improvements to the
          infrastructure <a href="references.html#ref27">[27]</a>. While, for
          the most part, the public is accessing everyday systems via mobile
          connections, it is common for fixed network connections to offer
          higher internet speeds in well-served areas. The preceding facts
          highlight the Lebanese reliance on mobile networks, and the likelihood
          that fixed networks will improve their ability to deliver faster and
          more reliable internet speeds.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Overall, the MENA region shows strong progress in internet adoption,
          driven largely by mobile connectivity, but disparities in
          infrastructure and speed remain between advanced and emerging markets.
          Lebanon reflects both the opportunities and challenges of the region,
          with high adoption rates but continuing struggles in delivering
          consistently fast and reliable internet access.
