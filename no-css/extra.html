        <h2>What is the latest version of HTML?</h2>
        <p>
          HTML 5.2, published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) on December
          14, 2017 <a href="references.html#ref32">[32]</a>, is the last
          finalized version of HTML released as a W3C Recommendation. Work on
          HTML 5.3 began afterward, but it was never completed or officially
          released. As a result, there is no official ‚Äúnext version‚Äù of HTML,
          such as HTML 6, and HTML 5.2 remains the latest formal snapshot by the
          W3C.
        </p>
        <p>
          The responsibility for maintaining the HTML specification has shifted
          from W3C to the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group
          (WHATWG), a consortium formed by leading browser companies, including
          Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft
          <a href="references.html#ref32">[32]</a>. WHATWG introduced the
          concept of the HTML Living Standard, which is continuously updated to
          reflect the latest features, improvements, and browser
          implementations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In May 2019, W3C and WHATWG signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
          to collaborate on a single version of the HTML and DOM specifications.
          This agreement formalized the transition: W3C no longer independently
          publishes HTML standards and instead works to bring WHATWG Review
          Drafts to W3C Recommendations. As part of this collaboration, W3C
          retired its HTML specifications, including HTML 5.2, on January 28,
          2021, in favor of the continuously evolving HTML Living Standard
          maintained by WHATWG <a href="references.html#ref33">[33]</a>.

        <h2>What are CSS rules and how do they work?</h2>
        <p>
          CSS rules determine how web page elements are presented and
          structured. Broadly, all CSS rules can be classified into two main
          categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Style rules: </strong>the standard rules most commonly used
            in CSS. They consist of a selector, which identifies the HTML
            element(s) to be styled, and a declaration block, which defines the
            properties and values. <br />

            <h4>Example:</h4>

            <pre>
  p {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 16px;
  } 
            </pre>
            <p>
              This rule sets the text color to blue and the font size to 16
              pixels for all elements. Style rules also follow the concept of
              specificity, which determines which rules take precedence when
              multiple rules target the same element. Understanding specificity
              is essential for avoiding conflicts and ensuring the intended
              styles are applied.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>At-rules: </strong>special instructions that start with the
            @ symbol and extend CSS beyond basic styling, such as including
            external stylesheets, applying conditional rules, or defining
            animations. Key examples include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <em>@import:</em> allows including external style sheets. This
                promotes modular and reusable CSS, though excessive use can slow
                page loading.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>@media:</em> applies styles conditionally based on device
                characteristics, such as screen size or orientation, enabling
                responsive design across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>@font-face:</em> lets designers embed custom fonts for
                consistent typography across platforms.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>@keyframes:</em> defines animations by specifying how
                element styles change over time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>@supports:</em> applies styles only if the browser supports
                certain CSS features, enhancing compatibility.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>@layer:</em> introduced recently to control the cascade and
                prioritize certain sets of styles, improving maintainability of
                complex CSS <a href="references.html#ref34">[34]</a>.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              At-rules give developers greater control over styling behavior,
              resource management, and interactivity. While style rules
              determine how elements look, at-rules dictate when, how, or from
              where styles are applied, significantly expanding the flexibility
              and power of CSS.

        <h2>Can URLs include non-Latin characters? How are they handled?</h2>
        <p>
          You can use non-Latin or Arabic words in a URL through
          Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) and Internationalized Resource
          Identifiers (IRIs).
        </p>
        <p>
          IDNs allow domain names (the ‚Äúexample.com‚Äù part) to include characters
          from scripts such as Arabic, Chinese, or Japanese. Internally,
          browsers convert these into Punycode, an ASCII-only representation, so
          servers can process the address. For example, the Arabic domain
          ‚ÄúŸÖÿ´ÿßŸÑ.ÿ•ÿÆÿ™ÿ®ÿßÿ±‚Äù becomes ‚Äúxn--mgbh0fb.xn--kgbechtv‚Äù when resolved
          <a href="references.html#ref40">[40]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          IRIs extend this support to the rest of the URL path, such as
          directories or file names. Non-ASCII characters in the path are first
          converted to UTF-8, then encoded using percent-encoding (e.g.,
          ‚ÄúŸÖŸÑŸÅ_ÿ™ÿ¨ÿ±Ÿäÿ®Ÿä.html‚Äù becomes
          ‚Äú%D9%85%D9%84%D9%81_%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A8%D9%8A.html‚Äù) so
          protocols like HTTP can transmit them safely
          <a href="references.html#ref40">[40]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, multilingual URLs make websites easier to read and remember
          worldwide, and modern browsers ensure safe use by preventing confusion
          or phishing.

        <h2>
          Does JavaScript Support Pre and Post Incrementation? What's the
          Difference?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, both pre-increment (++i) and post-increment (i++)
          operators increase a variable's value by 1, but they do so at slightly
          different times in the expression.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pre-increment (++i)</strong> ‚Üí increments the variable
            before returning it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Post-increment (i++)</strong> ‚Üí returns the current value
            first, then increments it afterward.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <pre>
      let i = 5;
         console.log(++i); // prints 6 (increment first, then return)

      let j = 5;
         console.log(j++); // prints 5 (return first, then increment)
        </pre>

        <p>
          For primitive values (like numbers), both perform almost the same.
          <br />
          However, when dealing with objects or arrays, i++ may create a
          temporary copy before incrementing, which can cause a small
          performance cost <a href="references.html#ref41">[41]</a>.
