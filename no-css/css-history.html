        <h2>Origins at CERN (1994-1995)</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language for styling documents
            written in HTML or XML, including XML-based formats such as SVG and
            XHTML. It specifies how elements should appear across different
            media, such as screens, print, or speech, and is essential for
            designing and developing web pages
            <a href="references.html#ref29">[29]</a>. CSS was created to address
            the growing need for separating content from presentation on the
            web. In the early 1990s, websites were largely structured with HTML
            alone, which combined content and presentation, leading to
            inconsistent styling and difficulties in maintaining large sites. In
            1994, Håkon Wium Lie, then working at CERN, proposed CSS as a
            solution to these challenges. Shortly afterward, Bert Bos joined the
            project, collaborating with Wium Lie to develop the first CSS
            specifications <a href="references.html#ref29">[29]</a>, allowing
            authors to define the visual presentation of HTML documents
            independently of the content.

        <h2>CSS1: The First Standard (1996)</h2>
        <p>
          The first official specification, CSS1, was published by the World
          Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1996. CSS1 provided basic styling
          capabilities such as fonts, colors, text alignment, margins, borders,
          and the box model <a href="references.html#ref29">[29]</a>, enabling
          web designers to standardize the look of web pages across different
          browsers.

      <section>
        <h2>CSS2: Expanding Capabilities (1998)</h2>
        <p>
          CSS2 was introduced in 1998 <a href="references.html#ref30">[30]</a>,
          adding features like absolute, relative, and fixed positioning,
          z-index layering, media types, and support for aural styles for
          accessibility. This allowed more complex layouts and increased control
          over how content was displayed on different devices.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>CSS 2.1: Stabilizing the Standard (2011)</h2>
        <p>
          CSS 2.1, finalized in June 2011, was a revision of CSS2 that addressed
          errors, ambiguities, and inconsistencies, creating a more stable and
          widely supported standard <a href="references.html#ref29">[29]</a>.
          Notably, the development of CSS3 had already begun in the early 2000s
          as a modular approach to extending styling capabilities. While
          browsers adopted CSS2.1 as the baseline, CSS3 modules were developed
          and implemented incrementally alongside CSS2.1 stabilization.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>CSS3: Modular Approach and Modern Features (2000s-2010s)</h2>
        <p>
          Work on CSS3 began in the early 2000s, but unlike earlier versions,
          CSS3 was modularized: each module, such as selectors, backgrounds,
          transitions, or animations, was developed independently. Some modules
          were finalized at different times, allowing browser vendors to
          implement and support new features incrementally. CSS3 introduced
          powerful modern styling capabilities, including flexible layouts,
          advanced selectors, transitions, animations, and media queries,
          enabling responsive design and richer user experiences across devices
          <a href="references.html#ref29">[29]</a>.

        <h2>Ongoing Evolution of CSS</h2>
        <p>
          As of 17 December 2016, CSS marked its 20th anniversary since the
          release of CSS1 <a href="references.html#ref31">[31]</a>, reflecting
          on two decades of growth and transformation. While the term CSS3 was
          widely used in the 2000s-2010s to describe modular updates, today that
          distinction is no longer made
          <a href="references.html#ref29">[29]</a>. Today, the features once
          grouped under CSS3 are considered part of the continuously evolving
          CSS, which is maintained as a living standard by the W3C CSS Working
          Group. This means CSS evolves continuously, with new capabilities
          being added independently rather than waiting for versioned releases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recent developments introduced features beyond the original CSS3 wave,
          including custom properties (CSS variables) for reusability, Grid
          Layout for powerful two-dimensional design, and container queries for
          more adaptive layouts. In addition, new pseudo-classes and
          pseudo-elements continue to expand the ability to style specific
          states and portions of content, offering greater precision and
          flexibility for designers <a href="references.html#ref29">[29]</a>.
          These advancements further strengthen CSS as an essential tool for
          responsive and modern web design.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          CSS has grown from a simple styling language into a dynamic and
          evolving standard, enabling consistency, accessibility, and creativity
          in web development. Its role as one of the three core technologies of
          the web ensures that it will remain vital for shaping user experiences
          across platforms well into the future. Today, CSS is used on nearly
          all websites, making it an essential and universally adopted
          technology for web design.
