        <h2>What is the latest version of HTML?</h2>
        <p>
          HTML 5.2, published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) on December
          14, 2017 <a href="references.html#ref32">[32]</a>, is the last
          finalized version of HTML released as a W3C Recommendation. Work on
          HTML 5.3 began afterward, but it was never completed or officially
          released. As a result, there is no official ‚Äúnext version‚Äù of HTML,
          such as HTML 6, and HTML 5.2 remains the latest formal snapshot by the
          W3C.
        </p>
        <p>
          The responsibility for maintaining the HTML specification has shifted
          from W3C to the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group
          (WHATWG), a consortium formed by leading browser companies, including
          Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft
          <a href="references.html#ref32">[32]</a>. WHATWG introduced the
          concept of the HTML Living Standard, which is continuously updated to
          reflect the latest features, improvements, and browser
          implementations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In May 2019, W3C and WHATWG signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
          to collaborate on a single version of the HTML and DOM specifications.
          This agreement formalized the transition: W3C no longer independently
          publishes HTML standards and instead works to bring WHATWG Review
          Drafts to W3C Recommendations. As part of this collaboration, W3C
          retired its HTML specifications, including HTML 5.2, on January 28,
          2021, in favor of the continuously evolving HTML Living Standard
          maintained by WHATWG <a href="references.html#ref33">[33]</a>.

      <section id="extra-CSS-rules">
        <h2>What are CSS rules and how do they work?</h2>
        <p>
          CSS rules determine how web page elements are presented and
          structured. Broadly, all CSS rules can be classified into two main
          categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Style rules: </strong>the standard rules most commonly used
            in CSS. They consist of a selector, which identifies the HTML
            element(s) to be styled, and a declaration block, which defines the
            properties and values. <br />

            <h4>Example:</h4>

            <pre>
  p {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 16px;
  } 
            </pre>
            <p>
              This rule sets the text color to blue and the font size to 16
              pixels for all elements. Style rules also follow the concept of
              specificity, which determines which rules take precedence when
              multiple rules target the same element. Understanding specificity
              is essential for avoiding conflicts and ensuring the intended
              styles are applied.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>At-rules: </strong>special instructions that start with the
            @ symbol and extend CSS beyond basic styling, such as including
            external stylesheets, applying conditional rules, or defining
            animations. Key examples include:
            <ul class="at-rules">
              <li>
                <em>@import:</em> allows including external style sheets. This
                promotes modular and reusable CSS, though excessive use can slow
                page loading.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>@media:</em> applies styles conditionally based on device
                characteristics, such as screen size or orientation, enabling
                responsive design across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>@font-face:</em> lets designers embed custom fonts for
                consistent typography across platforms.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>@keyframes:</em> defines animations by specifying how
                element styles change over time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>@supports:</em> applies styles only if the browser supports
                certain CSS features, enhancing compatibility.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>@layer:</em> introduced recently to control the cascade and
                prioritize certain sets of styles, improving maintainability of
                complex CSS <a href="references.html#ref34">[34]</a>.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              At-rules give developers greater control over styling behavior,
              resource management, and interactivity. While style rules
              determine how elements look, at-rules dictate when, how, or from
              where styles are applied, significantly expanding the flexibility
              and power of CSS.
            </p>

        <h2>Can URLs include non-Latin characters? How are they handled?</h2>
        <p>
          You can use non-Latin or Arabic words in a URL through
          Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) and Internationalized Resource
          Identifiers (IRIs).
        </p>
        <p>
          IDNs allow domain names (the ‚Äúexample.com‚Äù part) to include characters
          from scripts such as Arabic, Chinese, or Japanese. Internally,
          browsers convert these into Punycode, an ASCII-only representation, so
          servers can process the address. For example, the Arabic domain
          ‚ÄúŸÖÿ´ÿßŸÑ.ÿ•ÿÆÿ™ÿ®ÿßÿ±‚Äù becomes ‚Äúxn--mgbh0fb.xn--kgbechtv‚Äù when resolved
          <a href="references.html#ref40">[40]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          IRIs extend this support to the rest of the URL path, such as
          directories or file names. Non-ASCII characters in the path are first
          converted to UTF-8, then encoded using percent-encoding (e.g.,
          ‚ÄúŸÖŸÑŸÅ_ÿ™ÿ¨ÿ±Ÿäÿ®Ÿä.html‚Äù becomes
          ‚Äú%D9%85%D9%84%D9%81_%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A8%D9%8A.html‚Äù) so
          protocols like HTTP can transmit them safely
          <a href="references.html#ref40">[40]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, multilingual URLs make websites easier to read and remember
          worldwide, and modern browsers ensure safe use by preventing confusion
          or phishing.

        <h2>
          Does JavaScript Support Pre and Post Incrementation? What's the
          Difference?
        </h2>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, both pre-increment (++i) and post-increment (i++)
          operators increase a variable's value by 1, but they do so at slightly
          different times in the expression.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pre-increment (++i)</strong> ‚Üí increments the variable
            before returning it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Post-increment (i++)</strong> ‚Üí returns the current value
            first, then increments it afterward.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <pre>
  let i = 5;
    console.log(++i); // prints 6 (increment first, then return)

  let j = 5;
    console.log(j++); // prints 5 (return first, then increment)
        </pre>

        <p>
          For primitive values (like numbers), both perform almost the same.
          <br />
          However, when dealing with objects or arrays, i++ may create a
          temporary copy before incrementing, which can cause a small
          performance cost <a href="references.html#ref41">[41]</a>.

        <h2>
          What Are Regular Expressions? How Do They Work in JavaScript and
          Python?
        </h2>

        <p>
          A regular expression (or regex) is a sequence of characters that
          defines a search pattern. It is used to find, match, replace, or
          validate text, such as verifying an email address, extracting numbers,
          or cleaning up data. <br />
          Regex patterns are supported by most programming languages, and while
          syntax details can vary, the main idea is to describe text patterns
          precisely.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following table summarizes the essential parts of regex syntax
          used in most programming languages:

        <p>
          These symbols form the universal core of regex used across most
          languages, including JavaScript and Python. Note that special
          characters in regex need to be escaped with a backslash (\) to be
          treated literally. For example, use \. to match a literal dot.
        </p>

        <h3>Regex in JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
          In JavaScript, regular expressions are objects that define patterns to
          match character combinations in strings.<br />
          They are commonly used with:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>RegExp</strong> methods: test() and exec().</li>
          <li>
            <strong>String</strong> methods: match(), matchAll(), replace(),
            search(), and split() <a href="references.html#ref45">[45]</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Example:</h4>

        <pre>

const re1 = /ab+c/;  // Literal notation (compiled when the script loads)


const re2 = new RegExp("ab+c");  // Constructor function (compiled at runtime)
            </pre
        >

        <ul>
          <li>Use the literal form for fixed patterns (faster performance).</li>
          <li>
            Use the constructor when building dynamic patterns (for example,
            from user input).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Do Websites Keep Your Passwords Secure?</h2>
        <p>
          When you type your password into a website or app, you might wonder if
          someone behind the scenes can see it. In a secure system, no one, not
          even the IT team, can view your actual password. This is because of a
          process called <strong>hashing</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hashing process involves using a hash function, which converts
          your password into a fixed, seemingly random string of characters
          known as a hash. This function is one-way, meaning it cannot be
          reversed to reveal the original password.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most modern systems also use a method called <strong>salting</strong>.
          Salting is the process of adding a unique, random value (called a
          salt) to a plaintext password before hashing it. This ensures that
          even if two users choose the same password, their resulting hashes
          will be completely different. Salting is important because it makes
          several common attacks much harder to perform. These attacks include
          <strong>dictionary attacks</strong> (using lists of common passwords),
          <strong>rainbow table attacks</strong> (using precomputed hash
          databases), and <strong>brute-force attacks</strong> (trying every
          possible combination) <a href="references.html#ref46">[46]</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Common hash functions include: <strong>MD5</strong>,
          <strong>Bcrypt</strong>, <strong>Scrypt</strong>, and
          <strong>Argon2</strong> <a href="references.html#ref46">[46]</a>. Each
          algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses, but all are designed
          to securely store passwords.
        </p>

        <p>
          When a user tries to log in, the system takes the entered password and
          applies the same hashing process using the stored salt. It then
          compares the new hash with the one saved in the database. If the two
          hashes match, the password is verified and access is granted, all
          without ever storing or revealing the actual password.
