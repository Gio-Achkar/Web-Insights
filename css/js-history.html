        <h2>The Birth of JavaScript (1995)</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript's story begins in 1995 at Netscape Communications. Brendan
          Eich, a programmer at Netscape, was tasked with creating a scripting
          language for the company's popular browser at the time, Netscape
          Navigator. In just 10 days, Eich developed the first version of the
          language. Initially called “Mocha,” then “LiveScript,” it was
          eventually renamed JavaScript in December 1995 as a marketing strategy
          to ride the popularity wave of Java at the time. Despite the name
          similarity, JavaScript was entirely different, and was designed as a
          lightweight interpreted scripting language to bring interactivity and
          ease of use to web pages <a href="references.html#ref35">[35]</a>.

      <section id="js-history-standardization">
        <h2>Standardization of JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
          As JavaScript spread, Microsoft introduced its own implementation in
          Internet Explorer called JScript. This sparked many incompatibility
          issues as developers had to write code differently for each browser.
          To address this chaos, the different browser vendors on the market
          during that time all agreed to use JavaScript in their browsers. As a
          result, Netscape submitted JavaScript for standardization in 1997
          under the name ECMAScript by the European Computer Manufacturers
          Association (ECMA) <a href="references.html#ref36">[36]</a>. It is
          important to note that ECMAScript is not a separate language, but
          rather a standardized specification that defines how the language
          works. JavaScript is the most widely used implementation of this
          standard <a href="references.html#ref37">[37]</a>. This
          standardization provided consistency across browsers and laid the
          foundation for JavaScript's long-term growth.

        <h2>Key Milestones in JavaScript's Evolution</h2>
        <p>
          While JavaScript's birth in 1995 and its standardization as ECMAScript
          in 1997 laid the foundation, the years that followed brought rapid
          growth and transformation. From enabling dynamic web applications to
          expanding beyond the browser, JavaScript evolved into a versatile and
          powerful language. The timeline below highlights some of the most
          significant updates and milestones from the 2000s onward.

        <h2>Global Dominance</h2>
        <p>
          Today, JavaScript is the backbone of the web. It is universally
          supported by all major browsers and drives countless frameworks and
          libraries such as React, Angular, and Vue. As of 2025, JavaScript is
          used by approximately 98.9% of websites, underscoring its immense
          popularity in web development
          <a href="references.html#ref39">[39]</a>. The diagram below highlights
          the prominence of JavaScript, showing its position as the most widely
          used programming language among developers in 2024.

        <p>
          Notably, JavaScript continues to evolve as a living standard. Each
          year, a new ECMAScript edition is published, incorporating the latest
          approved features. As of 2025, the current specification is ECMAScript
          2025 (ES2025), which represents the 16th edition of the language
          <a href="references.html#ref38">[38]</a>. This ongoing process ensures
          JavaScript remains modern, relevant, and capable of meeting the needs
          of developers worldwide.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          From a rushed project in 1995 to a global standard, JavaScript's
          growth reflects the evolution of the internet itself. Its
          adaptability, community support, and continuous updates have secured
          its place as the world's most essential programming language.
